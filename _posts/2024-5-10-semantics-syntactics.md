title: Semantics, syntactics

It's been a while since i've used .md files for something other than Discord; I should code more. Concurrently, it's _also_ been a while since I've typed using capitalized letters; I should get out more.
Anyways, the overarching goal is for this intro to get buried by leagues of other notes I take about concepts in CS, maths, psychology, or whatever else floats my boat. More to come soon.
