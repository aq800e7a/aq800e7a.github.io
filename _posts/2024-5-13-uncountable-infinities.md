title: Uncountable infinities
---

Earlier today, my boyfriend and I discussed a question he was asked by a friend, and I'm happy to report that I found it blogworthy. While the intuition behind the problem seems simple, I question if I'd know how to prove the solution: simply put, is the number of disparate infinities countably or uncountably infinite?\
My thought process began here: consider the set $`\mathcal{A} = \{ \mathbf{N}, \mathcal{P} \{ \mathbf{N} \}, \mathcal{P} \{ \mathcal{P} \{ \mathbf{N} \} \},... \}`$ which contains a countable number of infinities, each of a distinct size. Subsequently, we take $`\mathcal{P}\{A\}`$, which contains a uncountably infinite number of sets that contain varying sizes of infinity, and generate infinities that distinctly represent each element $n$ of $`\mathcal{P}\{A\}`$ like so:\
Given element $`n = \{m_1, m_2,...m_l\}`$ where the cardinality of some $m \in n$ is a disparate sized infinity, we construct a new 
infinity of size $`{|m_1|}^{{|m_2|}^{{...}^{{|m_l|}}}}`$ that represents the $\inf$-asignment of $`n \in \mathcal{P}\{A\}`$.\
Now, we have an uncountably infinite set $`\mathcal{P}\{A\}`$ that contains elements that have each been designated a different sized infinity, subsequently showing that there are at least an uncountable number of infinities.\
Of course, this proof has its holes, especially when it comes to duplicates, and so I decided to look for a more definitive answer. Upon doing so, I stumbled across aleph numbers, the Burali-Forti paradox, the Continuum hypothesis, and aleph-omega, but no real *proof* if you will (I could also be bad at searching for things on the internet, though, so that may be on me. As it stands, I understand that there are uncountable infinities, but if anyone can explain exactly whyâ€“ well, shoot me an email!
