title: Uncountable infinities
---

Earlier today, my boyfriend and I discussed a question he was asked by a friend, and I'm happy to report that I found it blogworthy. While the intuition behind the problem seems simple, I question if I'd know how to prove the solution: simply put, is the number of disparate infinities countably or uncountably infinite?
My thought process began here: consider the set $`\mathcal{A} = \{ \mathbf{N}, \mathcal{P} \{ \mathbf{N} \}, \mathcal{P} \{ \mathcal{P} \{ \mathbf{N} \} \},... \}`$ which contains a countable number of infinities, each of a distinct size. Subsequently, we take $`\mathcal{P}\{A\}`$, which contains a countably infinite number of combinations of the above infinities and employ a schema to generate infinities that distinctly represent each element $n$ of $`\mathcal{P}\{A\}`$ like so: given element $`n = \{m_1, m_2,...m_l\}`$ (again, with the cardinality of some $m \in n$ being a disparate sized infinity), we construct an infinity of size $`{|m_1|}^{{|m_2|}^{{...}^{{|m_l|}}}}`$
Zooming right over the initial logic, I've found myself face-to-
