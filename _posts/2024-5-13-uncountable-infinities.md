title: Countable or uncountable infinities?
---

Earlier today, my boyfriend and I started discussing a question that his friend asked him, and I found it blogworthy. While the intuition behind it seems simple, I question if I'd know how to prove the solution: simply put, is the number of disparate infinities countably or uncountably infinite?
My thought process began here: consider the set $\mathcal{A} = {\mathbf{N}, \mathcal{P}\{\mathbf{N}\}, \mathcal{P}\{\mathcal{P}\{\mathbf{N}\}\},...}$ which contains a countable number of infinities, each of a distinct size. Subsequently, we take the powerset of $\mathcal{A}$, which 
Zooming right over the initial logic, I've found myself face-to-
