title: Uncountable infinities
---

Earlier today, my boyfriend and I discussed a question he was asked by a friend, and I'm happy to report that I found it blogworthy. While the intuition behind the problem seems simple, I question if I'd know how to prove the solution: simply put, is the number of disparate infinities countably or uncountably infinite?
My thought process began here: consider the set $`\mathcal{A} = \{ \mathbf{N}, \mathcal{P} \{ \mathbf{N} \}, \mathcal{P} \{ \mathcal{P} \{ \mathbf{N} \} \},... \}`$ which contains a countable number of infinities, each of a distinct size. Subsequently, we take $`\mathcal{P}\{A\}`$, which contains a countably infinite number of infinities, and generate infinities that distinctly represent each element $n$ of $`\mathcal{P}\{A\}`$ like so:
Given element $`n = \{m_1, m_2,...m_l\}`$ where the cardinality of some $m \in n$ is a disparate sized infinity, we construct a new infinity of size $`{|m_1|}^{{|m_2|}^{{...}^{{|m_l|}}}}`$ that represents the $\inf$-asignment of $`n \in \mathcal{P}\{A\}`$.
Zooming right over the initial logic, I've found myself face-to-
